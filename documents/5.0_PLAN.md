# Project Plan

## Overview
HS Code Classifier Application with 99.99% accuracy. Self-managed PostgreSQL database with Terraform + application for HS code classification.

**Company:** Israeli company serving worldwide customers  
**Business Model:** B2B (Business-to-Business)

**Environments:** Local development and staging only. Production environment will be added when client is secured.

## Final Application Goal: HS Code Classifier

**Target Accuracy:** 99.99%

**Core Features:**
1. **HS Code Classification:**
   - Classify product descriptions to HS codes with 99.99% accuracy
   - **Classification based on known customs books** (country-specific)
   - **Israel:** 3 customs books (verify and implement all 3)
   - **Other countries:** Different customs books and rules (support country-specific classification)
   - If HS code unknown, ask clarifying questions about the product to determine correct code
   - Reject abstract descriptions (e.g., "gift", vague terms) - reply that description is insufficient for classification

2. **Company Item Code Lists:**
   - Users can upload lists of company item codes with corresponding HS codes
   - If product description matches item in uploaded list, return HS code from list
   - Cost per transaction: X/D (where D = number of items in list, or similar division)

3. **Pricing Model:**
   - **Standard classification:** Cost X per transaction
   - **Company list lookup:** Cost X/D per transaction (reduced cost when using uploaded lists)
   - **Interactive/Abstract description:** Cost M×X per transaction (multiplier M for cases requiring questions or abstract description handling)

4. **Country-Specific Customs Books:**
   - Support multiple countries with their respective customs books
   - Israel: 3 customs books (primary focus)
   - Other countries: Different books and classification rules
   - User selects country/customs book before classification

5. **Service Access Methods (Unified Workflow):**
   All methods follow the same pattern:
   - User provides product description
   - User specifies customs book (optional, defaults if not provided)
   - System processes classification
   - User receives HS code result(s) for item(s)
   
   **Interactive Workflow Continuation (API Methods):**
   - If classification requires interactive questions, system returns session ID
   - User can continue workflow by sending session ID + answers via API
   - Process continues until classification is complete or session expires
   
   **Access Methods:**
   - **Frontend App:** Web interface for interactive classification with real-time Q&A
   - **Email to Email:** Send email with product description and customs book, receive email with HS code result(s)
   - **API Webhook (Asynchronous):** Fire-and-forget API call, receive result via webhook callback (or session ID if interactive). Continue workflow with session ID + answers
   - **API Synchronous:** Client waits for answer, immediate response with HS code(s) or questions. Continue workflow with session ID + answers

## Phase 1: Infrastructure (Terraform)
**Goal:** Provision PostgreSQL on cost-effective provider

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Terraform configuration
- [ ] Networking/security
- [ ] Credentials/secrets
- [ ] Backups/monitoring
- [ ] Test provisioning

**Time:** 3-6 hours  
**Cost:** $4-12/month

## Phase 2: Database Schema
**Goal:** Define complete schema in `init.sql` for all application data (HS code classifier, B2B, users, groups, payments, etc.)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `init.sql` (single source of truth)
- [ ] **User Management:**
  - [ ] Users table (link to Clerk user IDs)
  - [ ] User profiles and preferences
  - [ ] User authentication metadata
- [ ] **B2B/Organization:**
  - [ ] Organizations table (link to Clerk organization IDs)
  - [ ] Organization profiles and settings
  - [ ] Organization members and roles
  - [ ] Organization-level data isolation
  - [ ] Groups/teams within organizations
- [ ] **HS Code Classifier:**
  - [ ] Classifications table (requests, results, status)
  - [ ] Questions table (interactive Q&A sessions)
  - [ ] Interactive workflow sessions table (session ID, status, questions asked, answers received, pending questions, expiration time)
  - [ ] Customs books tables (country, book versions, HS codes, rules)
  - [ ] Company item code lists (uploaded lists, item mappings, organization linkage)
  - [ ] Transaction/pricing tables (track costs: X, X/D, M×X per transaction)
- [ ] **Payments:**
  - [ ] Payment accounts table (link to Payoneer, organization linkage)
  - [ ] Payment transactions table (incoming/outgoing, status, currency)
  - [ ] Invoices table (B2B invoice tracking, payment terms)
  - [ ] Scheduled payments table (custom recurring payment logic)
- [ ] **Service Access:**
  - [ ] API keys and authentication tokens
  - [ ] Webhook configurations (client webhook URLs)
  - [ ] Job queue table (async API processing)
- [ ] **Audit & Logging:**
  - [ ] Audit logs table (user actions, classification history)
  - [ ] Error logs table
- [ ] Migration system
- [ ] Indexes and performance optimization
- [ ] Document schema

**Time:** 8-12 hours

## Phase 3: Application Core Infrastructure
**Goal:** Core application infrastructure and database utilities

**Stack:** TypeScript (strict), Node.js, PostgreSQL (pg), tRPC, React (if UI), Global DRY CSS

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Database connection management (pg client, connection pooling)
- [ ] Query execution utilities (type-safe queries, error handling)
- [ ] CRUD operation helpers (reusable patterns)
- [ ] Database health checks
- [ ] Backup/restore utilities
- [ ] Migration system integration
- [ ] Multi-currency support utilities (for worldwide customers)
- [ ] Timezone handling utilities (for international customers)
- [ ] Organization/tenant isolation middleware (B2B multi-tenancy)
- [ ] Organization-level access control utilities
- [ ] Shared types and constants (from `src/shared/single-source.ts`)
- [ ] Error handling system (`AppError` pattern)
- [ ] Logging system integration
- [ ] Environment configuration (local/staging setup, environment variables)
- [ ] **Caching Strategy:** PostgreSQL's built-in caching (shared buffers) should be sufficient initially. Consider external cache (Redis) only if: high traffic volume, session data needs fast access, or rate limiting requires distributed counters. Start with PostgreSQL caching, add Redis later if needed.

**Time:** 8-12 hours
